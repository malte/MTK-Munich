### me
My name is Malte and my Tai Chi Journey started 2012 in Berlin Neukölln. I started the practice to fix a shoulder injury, but was then quickly hooked by the intriguing movements and concepts of Tai Chi Chuan. I stayed with it, and my shoulder got better too. After some years of training i reached the first teacher grade, and so started teaching beginner classes.
### and my and their teachers:
#### Alex Tschöpe
was my teacher in Berlin. He soon encouraged me (and the other students) to join the seminars with his teacher, Fernando Chedel, so we could experience first hand, what Tai Chi was really all about. He had practised with Fernando for many years at this point and was able to inspire an strong interest in the art for me.
#### Fernando Chedel
is the lineage holder of Ma Tsun Kuen Tai Chi Chuan and teaches students mostly in europe and south america. Regularly, there are seminars with Fernando in northern Spain. Through the teachings from Fernando i learned, that this martial art encompasses much more than the physical aspect and the practice of forms and drills. Fernandos teacher was
#### Ma Tsun Kuen
, a former chinese province govourner, who learned Tai Chi Chuan from a captive "strange man" — a taoist. Later Ma Tsun Kuen exiled to Argentina, where Fernando became his student and later his successor.
