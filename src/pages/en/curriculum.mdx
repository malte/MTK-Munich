Traditionally, tai chi students are not given grades (more a japanese and korean tradition). To keep an overview over the students level and to structure the curriculum, they were introduced to the ma tsun kuen system anyway and the curriculum is structured in these grades:

<Card title="5º Student - yellow" meta="min. 3 month of practice" color="yellow-300">
#### Standing Practice
In standing practice, we teach the body to let go of unnecessary tension, and to develop a good, upright, and relaxed posture: Ma Bu, horse (riders) stance and Ting Bu: false leg stance
#### Set of six Tsao (Exercises)
These exercises combine a relaxed body sensation with coordinated movements. They function as a foundation to all other elements of practice.
#### The short form or "shisan shi"
the first form we practice. It is easy to remember, symmetric and focuses on the 13 energies of Tai Chi. Peng, Lu, Ji, An, Kai, Lie, Zhou, Kao + the 5 directions.

<Card title="4º Student - orange" meta="min. 9 month of practice" color="amber-400">

#### Basic and Free Tui Shou Practice

Although often called pushing hands, the term "pushing" is somewhat misleading, it should rather be called maybe "sensing" or "listening" hands.
In this exercise we examine moving energies with a partner in a cooperative exchange. We try encounter the postures and techniques from the form in the exchange, to fill the form with meaning and the tui shou practice with intention.
Sometimes it can feel like a play fight, which is fun, but holds the danger of forgetting the "sensing" or "listening" part.
