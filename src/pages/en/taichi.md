# Tai Chi Chuan

There are many translations for Tai Chi and the one like the best is: "the supreme balance" and refers to the the cosmological relationship of Yin and Yang.
Chuan means "fist", or "boxing" and refers to being a martial art.

It can be written in different ways:
太极拳 (simplified chinese)
Tài chí chuán (Wade-Giles)
Tàijí quān (Pinjin)

### Sometimes it easier to say what its not:

Although it can quiet the monkey mind and help you being in the moment,
it is <u>not _just_ a meditation.</u>
In spite of the wonderful health benefits and sometimes silly outfits, that practitioners wear,
<u>it is not aerobics.</u>
There is no hard hitting in the practice, no stress simulation and no tricks,
so its <u>not a self defence method.</u>
And there are also no rules and no points to gain,
so its <u>not a combat sport.</u>

### So what is it?

Let's look at some humorous nicknames, that hint to the true nature of its practice:
**Chinese Fist Yoga** and **Rentnerkarate (Karate for Seniors)**

It comes from China, it is a martial art (fist / karate), it is a complete system that focuses on strengthening the health and rejuvenating the body (like yoga), and it can be practiced by people of old age, be that because their body is still young through practice, or because the practice is not demanding on older muscles and bones — both are valid points.
And finally, as Master Ma (Tun Kuen) has put it:

> Tai Chi is a philosophy,<br> that is understood through the body.

### Tai Chi Principles

Don't use force.
Don't lean or use your body weight momentum.
If one part is still, all parts are still and if one part moves, all the part move.

### Health aspects

**about one self**
Reconnect to yourself, through harmony and relaxation, balance and focus.
Regular practice works on your posture, your breathing, the ability to cope with stress, releases tension and improves your balance. It can quiet the monkey mind and strengthen your mental focus. There is also no age boundary, this is a practice you can keep on doing, on and on, and it only gets better.

The health benefits of practicing Tai Chi are numerous and well documented even in western medicine. Here are some links on<br> [Diabetes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38313854/), [Parkinsons](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35125106/), [Insomnia](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33587135/), [Mental Health & Depression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36833525/)

### Martial aspects

**Self & Other: the Chuan in Tai Chi Chuan**
There are no rules in martial art, only politeness. That said, this not a self defence class, nor a combat sport, yet all aspects of tai chi chuan root deeply in martial art and are practised as such.

"Boxing" tui shou, partner work, can take different forms and therefore also be seen as a soft sparring, that focuses on technical aspects. It is much more than that of course, creating the possibilty to "listen" with your hands and to create connection without words, learning about the balance and boundaries of your opponent (and yourself).
