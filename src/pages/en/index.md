## Mission and Vision
We are dedicated to explore the original Tai Chi Chuan and its miraculous effects on the body and the mind.

Elasticity instead of Rigidity,
connection instead of isolation,
integral efficient movement  
instead of mechanical effort.  
Relaxation without collapsing,  
naturalness without excess.  
—  
philosophy through the body.

**Come and learn Tai Chi Chuan with us.**

## Why Tai Chi
What is good for? – absolutely everything!
##### Health aspects: about one self
Good for posture, breathing and balance.
By practice harmony and relaxation, balance and focus, you reconnect to yourself and experience — as Master Ping Xiao Po (Kung Fu Panda) puts it — inner peace.

##### Martial aspects: self & other — the chuan in taichi chuan
All aspects of tai chi chuan root deeply in martial art and are practiced as such.
That said, this not a self defence class, nor a combat sport,
there are no rules in martial art, only politeness.
We connect with each other without agenda, just sensing energies.
