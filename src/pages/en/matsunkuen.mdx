### Foundation Exercises
In **Standing Practice**, we teach the body to let go of unnecessary tension, and to develop a good, upright, and relaxed posture: Ma Bu, horse (riders) stance and Ting Bu: false leg stance

A **Set of six Tsao (Exercises)** combine a relaxed body sensation with harmonious movements. These serve as a foundation to all other elements of practice.

### Forms
**The short form or "shisan shi"** is the first form we practice. It is easy to remember, symmetric and focuses on the 13 energies of Tai Chi. Peng, Lu, Ji, An, Kai, Lie, Zhou, Kao + the 5 directions.

**The long form** follows the images of the Yang Tai Chi long form and serves as a body for the techniques of Ma Tsun Kuen Tai Chi Chuan.
<br /><br />*later we also learn a fast form, a partner form and weapon forms.*

### Partner Exercises

Basic and free **Tui Shou** practice
is often called pushing hands. The term "pushing" is somewhat misleading, it should rather be called maybe "sensing" or "listening" hands.
In this exercise we examine moving energies with a partner in a cooperative exchange. We try encounter the postures and techniques from the form in the exchange, to fill the form with meaning and the tui shou practice with intention.
Sometimes it can feel like a play fight, which is fun, but holds the danger of forgetting the "sensing" or "listening" part.

There are four partner exercise **movement patterns** in the Ma Tsun Kuen system. These deal with understanding distance, stepping, direction of force, changing direction, and rotational forces.
Kilometros, Rombo, Da Lu, and Saopapu.

### Martial chi kung (I Ching Kung)
A set of ten **Qigong Exercises**, that is build on **daoist breathing** and work with the "Yi" (will, intention) in form of mental images of reaching and stretching.

## Graduation System
Traditionally, tai chi students are not given grades (more a japanese and korean tradition). To keep an overview over the students level and to structure the curriculum, they were introduced to the ma tsun kuen system anyway and the curriculum is structured in these grades:
