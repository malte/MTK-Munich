##### Martial aspects: self & other ‚Äî the chuan in taichi chuan
All aspects of tai chi chuan root in martial art and are practiced as such.
That said, this not a self defence class, nor a combat sport.
There are no rules in martial art, only politeness.
We connect with each other without agenda, just sensing energies, with the mind on learning.
