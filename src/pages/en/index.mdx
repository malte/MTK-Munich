##### Health aspects: about one self
By practicing harmony and relaxation, balance and focus, you can reconnect body and mind and experience ‚Äî as Master Ping Xiao Po (Kung Fu Panda) puts it ‚Äî inner peace
<br/>

The training also works on posture, breathing (I Ching Kung) and balance in a positive way.

##### Martial aspects: self & other ‚Äî the chuan in taichi chuan
Tai Chi Chuan is a martial art and we are practing it in that spirit, by examining the movements of the form for their original applications.
<br />That said, this not a self defence class, nor a combat sport.
There are no rules in martial art, only politeness.
We connect with each other without agenda, just sensing force and energy, with the mind on learning.

**Are you a beginner? Welcome!**<br/>
Start your Tai Chi journey with us! Ma Tsun Kuen TCC holds a complete training system, and the curriculum builds slowly.

**You want to reconnect to your former Tai Chi experience? Welcome!**<br/>
You will feel right at home with this style. Like every Tai Chi Style it is rooted in the [Tai Chi Principles](./taichi#Tai-Chi-Principles) and the long form uses the same images as the long form from Yang Style Tai Chi Chuan.

**There are no age boundaries.**<br/>
If you can stand, you can practice tai chi.
