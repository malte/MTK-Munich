<p>I used to teach tcc (tai chi chuan) in Berlin for a few years. Now, that i live in Munich, i want to share my art.
Not only because i enjoy teaching the things that i have learned, but also because this style or even something similar (as far as i know) is not taught elsewhere in munich; and i firmly believe in its immense value.</p>
<p>My tcc journey started in 2012, not having any idea about what tai chi might be. I was just looking for a soft movement to help healing a shoulder injury. The closest school to my home in Berlin Neukölln was lead by …</p>
<h2 id="alex-tschöpe">Alex Tschöpe</h2>
<p>who – for the first years – was my only teacher. The shoulder problems were quickly resolved and forgotten. But now i was intrugued by this weird sport? meditation? martial art? After a while i started to join the seminars, where i got introduced to his teacher,</p>
